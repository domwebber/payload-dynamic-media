# Payload CMS Dynamic Media Plugin

This repository contains the **unofficial** Payload CMS Dynamic Media plugin.
It allows full and dynamic image alteration with sharp and supports storage for
media both locally and in third-party permanent storage.

This plugin is heavily inspired by and based on the code from the
[official Payload CMS Cloud Storage plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-cloud-storage).

## Why this plugin?

**Uses**\
This plugin was conceptualised for dynamic image resizing with sharp and
Next.js, the implementation for which was heavily inspired by
[the official Payload CMS Cloud Storage Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-cloud-storage)
and [express-sharp](https://github.com/pmb0/express-sharp).

**Instead of the official Payload CMS Cloud Storage Plugin?**\
This plugin provides the opportunity for dynamic resizing for images and media
whereas the [official plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-cloud-storage)
handles only storage and retrieval.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Payload version ```1.6.4``` or higher is required. Please note that this
  plugin *may* work on older versions, it just hasn't been tested.

npm install ...
